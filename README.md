Afraid of an asteroid-related catastrophe? 
Interested in understanding which parameters help predict an asteroid crash? 
You've come to the right repository...
This project aims to classify asteroids from NASA's JPL database as potentially hazardous (PHAs) or not potentially hazardous (non-PHAs)
This project was a part of my group project for my Data Mining masters course, but eventually I created a feedforward neural network 
with a 92% accuracy and continued working on it over the summer of 2024. 
This research received funding from the NSF and was named "The Best Undergraduate Research Project of 2024".
